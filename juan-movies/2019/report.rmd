# Motivation 

My friend Juan loves visual media and catalogs his rating of everything he watches over the course of the year. He's been doing this since 2016 and has recorded **658** movies, TV shows, shorts, and standup specials. 

Since IMDB publishes their data [online](https://datasets.imdbws.com/), I wanted to compare how his personal list of ratings compares against the general public for a few key metrics: 

- Popularity (number of votes)
- Genre
- Year released
- Runtime
- Year viewed by Juan


To accomplish this, I needed to tackle the following issues: 

- Efficiently matching entries by title given the size of the IMDB data ( > 1 GB .tsv files)
- Working with a lot of edge cases, typos, and inconsistently formatted titles from Juan's list
- Coherently presenting the interesting findings


This is an extension of an effort that I attempted last year, and an opportunity to utilize what I have learned since then. 

# The Findings

Lets get straight into the main findings, more details can be found below.

```{r, echo = F}
# Graphics
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(GGally)
library(EnvStats)
library(ggrepel)
library(stringr)
```

```{r, echo = F}
# create subsets based on type
juan_dt = data.table::fread('data/juan/cleaned_data.csv')
movie_dt = subset(juan_dt, Type_IMDB == 'movie')
tv_dt = subset(juan_dt, Type_IMDB == 'tvSeries')

# jayhawk colors
ku_blu = '#0066B1'
ku_red = '#E8000D'
ku_ylw = '#FFC82D'
ku_gry = '#85898A'
```

## Fig 1 - Media type

First I wanted to see how Juan's ratings differed from the general public based on the type of media. These categorizations come from IMDB, with a lot of smaller groups including "short", and differentiations between a tvMovie and movie. To simplify, I grouped these all into "other". 

We can see here that compared to the general public, Juan liked tv shows less than movies and tv Specials. The lack of outliers in the tv special category also indicates that he rates tv specials consistently above average. Notable outliers which may affect this relationship include Iron Fist and Unforgettable, both of which Juan's ratings had a 5 point discrepancy with the IMDB average. 

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, echo = F}
juan_dt$Type_IMDB = as.factor(juan_dt$Type_IMDB)
juan_dt$Type_IMDB = with(juan_dt, reorder(Type_IMDB, Type_IMDB, function(x) - length(x)))

type_comparisons = with(juan_dt,
                        list(
                          c(levels(Type_IMDB)[1], levels(Type_IMDB)[2]),
                          c(levels(Type_IMDB)[2], levels(Type_IMDB)[3])
                          )
                        )

ggplot(juan_dt, aes(x = as.factor(reorder(Type_IMDB, as.factor(Type_IMDB), function(x) - length(x))),
                    y = Rating_Diff)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'grey', size = 0.75) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, size = 0.6, coef = 0) +
  stat_compare_means(comparisons = type_comparisons, label = 'p.signif',
                     symnum.args = list(cutpoints = c(0, (0.05 / 6), 1), symbols = c("***", "")),
                     hide.ns = T, step.increase = 0.03, size = 4, tip.length = 0, label.y.npc = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(color = abs(Rating_Diff), size = abs(Rating_Diff))) +
  stat_n_text(y.expand.factor = 0.10) +
  geom_label_repel(data = subset(juan_dt, Rating_Diff < -4.75 |
                                          Rating_Diff > 3 |
                                          (Rating_Diff < -4 & Type_IMDB != 'movie')),
                   mapping = aes(label = Label), min.segment.length = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_size_continuous('', range = c(0.5, 4)) +
  scale_color_continuous('', low = 'gray90', high = ku_ylw) +
  labs(x = '') +
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = -0.5),
        legend.position = 'none')
```

## Fig 2 -  Decade

Next, I was interested about how the release date of these movies and tv shows impacted Juan's rating discrepancy. From these comparisons, Juan thinks that movies from the 80s and 2000s are lacking in comparison to more recent titles. A big factor in this difference may be the boomers that rate all their old favorites on IMDB. 


```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10, echo = F}
juan_dt$Year_Group = as.factor(juan_dt$Year_Group)

decade_comparisons = with(juan_dt,
                          list(
                              c(levels(Year_Group)[2], levels(Year_Group)[4]),
                              c(levels(Year_Group)[2], levels(Year_Group)[5]),
                              c(levels(Year_Group)[3], levels(Year_Group)[4]),
                              c(levels(Year_Group)[3], levels(Year_Group)[5])
                              )
                          )
ggplot(juan_dt, aes(x = Year_Group, y = Rating_Diff)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'grey', size = 0.75) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, size = 0.6, coef = 0) +
   stat_compare_means(comparisons = decade_comparisons, label = 'p.signif',
                      symnum.args = list(cutpoints = c(0, (0.05 / 10), 1), symbols = c("***", "")),
                      hide.ns = T, step.increase = 0.05, size = 4, tip.length = 0, label.y.npc = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(color = abs(Rating_Diff), size = abs(Rating_Diff))) +
  stat_n_text(y.expand.factor = 0.15) +
  geom_label_repel(data = subset(juan_dt, Rating_Diff < -4.75 |
                                 Rating_Diff > 3 |
                                 (Rating_Diff > 2.5 & Year_Group != '2015 - 2020')),
                   mapping = aes(label = Label), min.segment.length = 0) +
  scale_size_continuous('', range = c(0.5, 4)) +
  scale_color_continuous('', low = 'gray90', high = ku_red) +
  labs(x = '') +
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

## Fig 3 - Genre

Although Juan consistently rates titles higher than the general public when filtering by genre, there are notable differences in his rating variance. For example, it is clear that he consistently likes comedy and documentary titles, while horror titles have a much greater variance. 


```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10, echo = F}
ggplot(juan_dt, aes(x = reorder(Top_Genre, as.factor(Top_Genre), function(x) - length(x)),
                    y = Rating_Diff)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'grey', size = 0.75) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, size = 0.6, coef = 0) +
  geom_point(aes(color = abs(Rating_Diff), size = abs(Rating_Diff))) +
  stat_n_text(y.expand.factor = 0.15) +
  geom_label_repel(data = subset(juan_dt, Rating_Diff < -4.75 |
                                   Rating_Diff > 2.75 |
                                   (Rating_Diff < - 5)),
                   mapping = aes(label = Label), min.segment.length = 0, size = 3.5) +
  scale_size_continuous('', range = c(0.5, 4)) +
  scale_color_continuous('', low = 'gray90', high = ku_blu) +
  labs(x = '') +
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = -0.5, angle = -45),
        legend.position = 'none')
```

## Fig 4 - Popularity


I created a "Popularity" metric based on how many votes each title got on IMDB. The number of votes were split into 5 quantiles, with the lowest group assigned as "indie", the largest as "blockbuster", and the middle 3 as "regular". 

No significant relationship was observed between the three categories, although indie seemed to exhibit less overall variance. 


```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, echo = F}

juan_dt$Popularity = factor(juan_dt$Popularity, levels =  c('Indie', 'Regular', 'Blockbuster'))
# levels(juan_dt$Popularity) = c('Indie', 'Regular', 'Blockbuster')
# pop_comparisons = with(juan_dt,
#                        list(
#                          c(levels(Popularity)[1], levels(Popularity)[2]),
#                          c(levels(Popularity)[1], levels(Popularity)[3]),
#                          c(levels(Popularity)[2], levels(Popularity)[3])
#                        ))


ggplot(subset(juan_dt, !is.na(Popularity)), aes(x = Popularity, y = Rating_Diff)) +
 geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'grey', size = 0.75) +
  # stat_compare_means(comparisons = pop_comparisons, label = 'p.signif',
  #                    symnum.args = list(cutpoints = c(0, (0.05 / 3), 1), symbols = c("***", "")),
  #                    hide.ns = T, step.increase = 0.05, size = 4, tip.length = 0, label.y.npc = 1) +
 geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, size = 0.6, coef = 0) +
 geom_point(aes(color = abs(Rating_Diff), size = abs(Rating_Diff))) +
 stat_n_text(y.expand.factor = 0.15) +
 geom_label_repel(data = subset(juan_dt, Rating_Diff < -4.75 | Rating_Diff > 3),
                  mapping = aes(label = Label), min.segment.length = 0) +
 scale_size_continuous('', range = c(0.5, 4)) +
 scale_color_continuous('', low = 'gray90', high = ku_red) +
 labs(x = '') +
 theme_pubr() +
 theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

## Fig 5 - Votes

To visualize the number of votes in another way, I made a scatter plot comparing log transformed IMDB votes with the difference between Juan's and IMDB's ratings. Here, the LOESS smoothed regression line indicates that the relationship is not entirely heteroscedastic - Juan rates less popular movies worse than popular movies. An explanation for this relationship could be that only underground fans of the least popular titles submitted a rating, skewing the IMDB score upward. 

```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10, echo = F}
ggplot(juan_dt, aes(x = log(Votes_IMDB), y = Rating_Diff)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'grey', size = 0.75) +
  geom_point(color = ku_blu) +
  geom_smooth(size = 1.5, fill = 'grey80', color = ku_red) +
  scale_color_manual('', values = c(ku_gry, ku_ylw, ku_blu, ku_red)) +
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```


## Fig 6 - Time

Lastly, since Juan cataloged all of the rated titles in order, I could plot these entries by their sequence to see how his rating differences have evolved over time. Since 2016, Juan has remained fairly consistent in his ratings compared to the general population, however there is a notable dip in ratings towards the end of 2018, where almost every title was rated lower than IMDB. 


```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10, echo = F}
ggplot(juan_dt, aes(x = ID_Juan, y = Rating_Diff, color = as.factor(Viewed))) +
  geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'grey', size = 0.75) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(size = 1.5, fill = 'grey80') +
  scale_color_manual('', values = c(ku_gry, ku_ylw, ku_blu, ku_red)) +
  labs(x = '') +
  theme_pubr()
```

# Behind the Scenes

I used some of my favorite data cleaning libraries to work on this project, including:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(data.table)
library(stringr)
```

## Juan's List

The first step was to read in Juan's data and see what I was working with

```{r}
juan_dt = fread('data/juan/movies.csv')
head(juan_dt)
```

So he recorded the movie title, a rating out of 10 closed by parentheses, and the year in a second column. In order to match the titles to IMDB's data, the ratings had to be stripped and placed into their own column.

I used the str_extract function from stringr and some regex magic to match on the number prior to the '/' and place it in its own column called 'rating'

Breaking down the regex:
- (?<=[(]): matches on the left parentheses
- (.*?): matches everything after the left parentheses and before the next group
- (?=[/]): matches on the forward slash


```{r}
colnames(juan_dt) = c('Title', 'Viewed')
juan_dt$Rating = str_extract(juan_dt$Title, "(?<=[(])(.*?)(?=[/])")
head(juan_dt)
```


Theoretically, each rating should have two characters, so I checked for edge cases and found two of them and manually fixed them

```{r}
juan_dt[nchar(juan_dt$Rating) > 3, ]
juan_dt[nchar(juan_dt$Rating) > 3, ][, 'Rating'] = c(8.9, 9.2)
```

Now that all of the numbers were transferred correctly, I updated columns to their correct types

```{r}
# Convert to numeric
juan_dt$Rating = as.numeric(juan_dt$Rating)

# Viewed
# Convert to factor
juan_dt$Viewed = as.factor(juan_dt$Viewed)

```

Time to clean up those titles with some more regex:

```{r}
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub("(?=[(])(.*?)(?<=[)])", '', juan_dt$Title, perl = TRUE)
```

As expected: there were still a lot of edge cases including typos, issues with character conversion. and inconsistently formatted movie years:

```{r}
# Missing last parentheses
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('(?=[(]).*', '', juan_dt$Title_clean, perl = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# Manually cleaning additional issues & typos
juan_dt$Title_clean[415] = 'Halloween [2018]'
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('Hassan Minhaj', 'Hasan Minhaj', juan_dt$Title_clean)
```

```{r}
# Fix character conversion issues
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('â€™', "'", juan_dt$Title_clean)
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('Ã', 'i', juan_dt$Title_clean)
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('i¼', 'ü', juan_dt$Title_clean)
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('i¡', 'a', juan_dt$Title_clean)
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('i©', 'e', juan_dt$Title_clean)
```

After fixing the edge cases, I lowered all titles (to be matched with lowered titles from the IMDB dataset, and trimmed their whitespace)

``` {r}
# trim whitespace
juan_dt$Title_clean = trimws(juan_dt$Title_clean)

# lower all titles to aid matching
juan_dt$Title_clean = tolower(juan_dt$Title_clean)
```

Now that the titles have been reformatted, the remake indicators (designated by left and right brackets containing a year) need to be pulled and removed. I used the same strategy as with the ratings:

```{r}
# Add remake col
juan_dt$Year = str_extract(juan_dt$Title_clean, '\\d{4}')

# exclude edge cases
year_cases = c('blade runner: 2049', 'the shop: 2018 episodes', '2017')
juan_dt[juan_dt$Title_clean %in% year_cases][, 'Year'] = NA

# remove years from titles
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub('(\\[)(\\d{4})(\\])', '', juan_dt$Title_clean)
```

One last thing: removing seasons indicators and putting them in their own column

```{r}
# Add season col
juan_dt$Season = str_extract(juan_dt$Title_clean, '(?<=season |series |volume )(\\d{2}|\\d{1})')

# Fix edge case
juan_dt[juan_dt$Title_clean == 'axe cop: seasons 1-2'][, 'Season'] = '1-2'
juan_dt[juan_dt$Title_clean == 'axe cop: seasons 1-2'][, 'Title_clean'] = 'axe cop'

# remove seasons from titles
remove_seasons = '(?i)(: |! | - |\\? | )(season |series |volume |part )(\\d{2}|\\d{1})'
juan_dt$Title_clean = gsub(remove_seasons, '', juan_dt$Title_clean)

# trim whitespace again
juan_dt$Title_clean = trimws(juan_dt$Title_clean)
```

```{r}
# drop unformatted title
juan_dt$Title = NULL

colnames(juan_dt)[3] = 'Title'

# add id to ensure data is not lost
juan_dt$ID_Juan = seq(1: nrow(juan_dt))

```


## IMDB's ... DB

And that's it for Juan's data! Now onto the IMDB monolith:

```{r}
imdb_full = fread('data/imdb/title_basics.tsv', sep = '\t', na.strings = '\\N')
imdb_ratings = fread('data/imdb/title_ratings.tsv', sep = '\t')
imdb_season = fread('data/imdb/title_episode.tsv', sep = '\t')
```

That seemed to take a while, I wonder why?

```{r}
object.size(imdb_full)
nrow(imdb_full)
nrow(imdb_ratings)
nrow(imdb_season)
```

Oh. Let's check what is in each dataset:

```{r}
head(imdb_full)
head(imdb_ratings)
head(imdb_season)
```


Using these full data sets would make cleaning and especially matching much more cumbersome. First step is to drop the unneeded entries and fix the column names:


```{r}
imdb_full$endYear = NULL
colnames(imdb_full) = c('tconst' ,'Type_IMDB', 'Title', 'Title_IMDB', 'Adult_YN', 'Year_IMDB', 'Runtime', 'Genres')

# cut down imdb_full length
kept_types = c('movie', 'tvMiniSeries', 'tvMovie', 'tvSeries', 'tvSpecial', 'short', 'video', 'tvShort')
imdb_short = imdb_full[Type_IMDB %in% kept_types]
imdb_short$Year_IMDB = as.numeric(imdb_short$Year_IMDB)
imdb_short = imdb_short[Year_IMDB >= 1920]

```

Now lets check the number of rows:

```{r}
(nrow(imdb_short) / nrow(imdb_full)) * 100
```

Not a bad improvement. Now to modify the shortened data and merge the title information with the ratings and number of votes

```{r}
# merge ratings
imdb_short = imdb_ratings[imdb_short, on = 'tconst']
colnames(imdb_short)[2:3] = c('Rating_IMDB', 'Votes_IMDB')

imdb_dt = imdb_short[!is.na(imdb_short$Votes_IMDB) & imdb_short$Votes_IMDB > 300 & !is.na(imdb_short$Genres), ]

# lower titles
imdb_dt$Title = tolower(imdb_dt$Title)
```


The titles in the reduced dataset are now lowered and can be matched with juan's entries


```{r}
merged_full = juan_dt
merged_full = imdb_dt[merged_full, on = 'Title']


# copy for cleaning
merged_dt = merged_full
```

## Cleaning

Round 1: Strict, automated cuts

```{r}
Drop_Check = function(old_dropped, new_df){
  new_ids = unique(unlist(new_df[, 'ID_Juan']))
  all_ids = unlist(juan_dt[, 'ID_Juan'])
  new_dropped = juan_dt[!(all_ids %in% new_ids)][, 'ID_Juan']
  out = append(old_dropped, new_dropped)
  return(unique(unlist(out)))
}

Get_Dupe = function(x){return(duplicated(x) | duplicated(x, fromLast = TRUE))}
```

```{r}

# # drop titles that did not match an imdb entry
merged_dt = merged_dt[!is.na(tconst)]

# null b/c first time function is called so nothing to append to
dropped_ids = Drop_Check(NULL, merged_dt)

# if a title contains a season, then drop anything besides tvSeries
merged_dt = merged_dt[!(!is.na(Season) & Type_IMDB != 'tvSeries')]
dropped_ids = Drop_Check(dropped_ids, merged_dt)

# match entry to rerun year
merged_dt = merged_dt[(!is.na(Year) & Year == Year_IMDB) | is.na(Year)]

# sort by votes and keep the top entry for duplicated entries
merged_dt = merged_dt[merged_dt[, .I[which.max(Votes_IMDB)], by=ID_Juan]$V1]
dropped_ids = Drop_Check(dropped_ids, merged_dt)

# Change titles of dropped ids, then remerge
merged_redo1 = juan_dt[juan_dt$ID_Juan %in% dropped_ids]
merged_check1 = merged_full[merged_full$ID_Juan %in% dropped_ids]
```


Lets see how many titles were dropped:
```{r}
dropped_ids
```

A lot. And most of them are due to irregular discrepancies between how IMDB classified a title and how Juan did. This part will take some manual entry by searching Juan's entry on IMDB and typing in the closest match.

In the future, I could try a fuzzy matching approach in Python.
